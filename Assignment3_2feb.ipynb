    "##### Q1. What are the characteristics of the tuples? Is tuple immutable?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The characteristics of tuples in Python are:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordered: Tuples maintain the order of elements, so the first element in a tuple is considered the first element, the second element is considered the second, and so on.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable: Tuples are immutable, meaning once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneous: Tuples can contain elements of different data types.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexed: Each element in a tuple can be accessed by its index, starting from 0.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashable: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries because they are hashable, while lists are not.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Assignment: Tuples can be used to assign multiple values to multiple variables in a single line.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight: Tuples are more lightweight than lists, making them faster and more efficient for basic data storage and retrieval tasks.<br>\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "Ans.The two tuples methods in python are count and index.<br>\n",
    "count(): This method returns the number of occurrences of a specified element in the tuple.<br>\n",
    "Example:<br>\n",
    "t = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4)<br>\n",
    "print(t.count(2)) <br>\n",

    "t2 = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4)<br>\n",
    "print(t2.index(2)) <br>\n",

    "Tuples have only two in-built methods compared to lists because tuples are meant to be used for simple, immutable data structures that are used for basic tasks such as grouping and ordering data. On the other hand, lists are more flexible and have more methods to support more complex operations such as sorting, appending, and removing elements.<br>\n",
